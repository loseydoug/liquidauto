                <p>When manufacturing automation demands precision, Liquid
                Automation, Inc. is there, placing the most knowledgeable and
                dependable personnel at your site.
                We are proud to have access to the most qualified people in
                the field, capable of serving a multitude of areas of expertise
                and guaranteeing total satisfaction. Using the most conscientious
                and scrupulous methods, we hand pick our employees, from our
                contract engineers to our general laborers, and put into
                motion the most innovative and deviceful ideas in the
                manufacturing business today.</p>

                <p>Our experience in the machine tool industry has taught us the
                importance of employee performance and quality workmanship.
                In many cases quality is an attitude and should include not
                only meeting engineering and functional requirements,
                but also doing the quality workmanship necessary to produce
                a final product that is appealing to the eye.</p>

                <p>Quality is measured as a function of customer ratings, their
                perception of our overall performance and the cost of quality as
                an expense of doing things wrong. Continuously improving systems
                and procedures and communicating these with employees develops
                our high quality ratings, and ensures us a leadership position
                in our industry.</p>
